# Contributing to the Cdiscount’s Image Classification Challenge starter

Here, at [minerva.ml](https://minerva.ml) we created a starter code to the Kaggle's [Cdiscount’s Image Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdiscount-image-classification-challenge). You are very welcome to contribute your piece to this starter.

You can do it in two main ways:
1. Major - and most appreciated - way is to submit [pull request](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-cdiscount-starter/pulls) with additional feature or bug fix. Your pull request will be merged after some discussion.
2. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-cdiscount-starter/issues) (bug, feature request or question).
